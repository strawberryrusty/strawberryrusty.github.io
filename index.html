          <p> As a distinction holder in a Masters in Finance who has had experience working in London’s financial sector, I developed strong quantitative skills and a very analytical way of approaching problems. A set of attributes that I believe align seamlessly with my new career direction as a software engineer and will ultimately aid in my aspirations to become a Junior Web developer.

                       In our final project, as a duo we had a week to build a full-stack application. We created GymPro, where users can create their own exercises plans, track their personal best on each exercise, and learn more about the exercises available on the app. The application’s backend was built using Django and Python, while the frontend was built using React. I focussed heavily on the functionality of users adding exercise cards to each programme, and also designed the personal best tracker that updates every time a user inputs a new personal best for a specific exercise.

                    <p>
                      As a group of four, we had a week to build a full-stack application. With the growing sustainable food movement in the UK, especially within London, we built an application called “Lost the Plot”. The app allows users to create and share sustainable growth plots with each other and learn more about the types of vegetables they can grow around London.  We did this by using an Express API to serve data from a MongoDB database, and combining our back-end infrastructure with the front-end framework React. I heavily focused on creating a dynamic show page that displayed the details of each plot, the Plants Index infographic and the Plants database model in the backend.

                    <p>
                         This 2 day hackathon involved building a front-end only application using React, and sourcing our data from external API’s. We decided to build a podcast app sourcing our data from an API called listen notes, allowing users to search for all their favourite podcasts and discover the trending podcasts that week. I focused on building the show page when a user clicks on a specific podcast, and “Discovery” page where a user can listen to a random podcast at a click.

                    <p>
                       In my initial week-long project at GA, I chose to build the classic arcade game Snake, putting a Harry Potter-based twist on the game. The game was built using HTML, CSS, JS and DOM manipulation. In order to challenge ourselves, unlike other most approaches to web games, we were told to avoid the HTML Canvas approach, and instead I opted to my refine skills in vanilla JS and DOM manipulation to build the game grid, layout, logic and the dynamic movement of the Snake.

                    covered industry relevant languages and frameworks, as well as backend testing frameworks. Our days consisted of a daily standup, lessons, classwork, labs (individual and pair programming), and homework. During the course I produced four projects, which are outlined in the Projects section above.

                      I achieved a distinction in the highly esteemed MSc Finance & Investment programme. Placing special emphasis on the study of derivatives in my dissertation, I investigated whether derivate use effects firm value positively for 370 listed UK corporations. Outside of my studies, I played Lacrosse and was also a Retail Sector Equity Analyst for the NEFS's 2017 Equity Fund that managed over £13,000 in assets.

Forming trading teams from Sheffield, we competed in a virtual stock market trading simulation with investment societies from universities such as Leeds and York. As team leader of my group, we achieved second place in the competition by focussing predominantly on the Energy sector and mid-cap equities.
